 I built a Doctor-Patient Management System using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. It’s a RESTful backend that lets you perform full CRUD operations on doctors and patients. 
 I used Spring Data JPA for DB interactions and structured the app into controller, service, entity, and repository layers following clean architecture principles.
One of the key features is the one-to-many relationship between doctors and patients.
I tested the APIs using Postman and implemented validation and global exception handling for robustness.
The system is designed to be scalable, and I’m planning to add JWT-based security and Docker support as next steps.
